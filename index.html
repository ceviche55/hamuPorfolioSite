                My name is Khalid Hamu, and I come from Denver, Colorado. My interests revolve around various fields,
                including computers, art, animation, design, and engineering. My long-term goal is to combine some of my
                passions into my career and projects. Currently, I am pursuing a Computer Science major and a Digital
                Design minor at the University of Colorado Denver. I expect to graduate in the Spring of 2024 and aspire
                to work as a Software Engineer. While I am passionate about subjects outside of my major and minor, for
                now, they remain hobbies.

                The pandemic brought about a significant shift in me, and I now view the world through a different lens.
                With the luxury of time, I was able to explore my interests in greater detail. Prior to the pandemic, I
                would have classified myself as someone who had no inclination towards creative pursuits, such as art or
                design. However, as the world seemed to slow down, I found myself with more time to reflect on my
                passions. I started exploring the digital design world through online tutorials and was amazed at how
                much I enjoyed creating graphics and animations. As I became more confident in my abilities, I realized
                that I wanted to pursue a minor in Digital Design.

            <br>
            <p>
                This decision was not straightforward. Growing up, I was always drawn to math and logic, and I saw art
                and creativity as a separate realm that I didn't have a natural aptitude for. Yet, as I delved deeper
                into digital design, I discovered that creativity and logic are not mutually exclusive. I realized that
                designing requires both critical thinking and a keen eye for aesthetics, and it was fascinating to see
                how the two intersected. Moreover, I discovered that my newfound appreciation for digital design has
                influenced how I approach problem-solving in my computer science classes. I have begun to apply the
                design thinking process to my coding projects, which has resulted in more user-friendly interfaces and
                streamlined workflows. This cross-disciplinary approach has been rewarding, and I am excited to see
                where it takes me in the future.

                <p>
                    In designing and implementing the pet shop database, I took into consideration the requirements of
                    the system. This involved analyzing the different business processes, as well as understanding the
                    needs of the end-users. I also ensured that the database was properly normalized to avoid data
                    redundancy and inconsistencies, and that the queries were optimized. Using PHP and HTML, I was able
                    to create a user-friendly web interface that allowed users to interact with the database and access
                    information easily, which in turn helped improve the overall functionality and usability of the pet
                    shop system.

                <h2>Bank Account Monthly Statement</h2>
                <p>
                    The program I developed is designed to take in CSV files representing bank statements with
                    corresponding dates, and generate a summary of each month for each account. I implemented
                    appropriate data structures and algorithms in Python to accurately parse the CSV files, and wrote
                    optimized SQL queries to extract and summarize the data. Through the use of Python's data
                    visualization libraries, I created user-friendly outputs that made it easy to access and interpret
                    the generated summaries, making it an effective tool for account reconciliation and financial
                    management.
