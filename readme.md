## Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio website, so that I could showcase my projects. This allowed me the opurutunity to learn html and css and build a project around them. Upon trying to implement responsive design I have realized that I overestimated my capabilities so I will be leaving this as a static website.

Learning Targets:
- *HTML & CSS*
- *Basic Javascript*
- Responsive CSS
- *Web design*
